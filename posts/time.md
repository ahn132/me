title: 'What to do with Time?'

It's currently week 3 of my spring semester of college, and to be honest, I don't know what to do with my time.

I feel like throughout my past three semesters of college, I've dedicated a lot of time to various things
outside of class, in an attempt to improve myself and reach personal goals. However, nowadays, I don't really
feel like there's a goal that I really want to pursue anymore outside of just doing well in school.

So currently, I'm having an internal crisis. I don't want to just be sitting in bed watching k-dramas every time
I don't have homework, but I also just don't know what I want to do with my free time.

It just makes me wonder if this is what being an adult is really like. I feel like most adults just eat, sleep, work,
and repeat. Maybe with some television and family dinners in between. How boring...
